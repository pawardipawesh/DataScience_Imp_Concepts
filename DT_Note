Decision Tree
  •	Advantages
      I.	Easy to interpret
      II.	It’s okay even if you do not normalize
  •	Disadvantages
      I.	prone to overfitting if we don't control its depth
      II.	locally optimal i.e. it greedly chooses attribute to split on thereby sometimes looses optimal splitting point i.e. It may happen that at this point some attribute with less purity at next level might produce more pure tree finally
      III.	prone to sampling
•	How to control Depth
      I.	Stop once node is pure
      II.	Stop once very few samples are remaining in node
      III.	Stop once impurity is not reducing much
      IV.	Stop once cross-validation impurity starts increasing
      V. Stop once no of nodes in tree are reached to given value
