12.	probability distributions : https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/probability-distributions/
13.	Normal Distribution : https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/normal-distribution/
		- symmetric around mean
		- equal number of data points below and above mean
14.	Empirical Rule : https://statisticsbyjim.com/probability/empirical-rule/
		- Works only for normal distribution
		- 68 % of data points are withing 1 std deviation from mean
		- 95 % of data points are within 2 st deviation from mean
		- 99.7 % of data points are within 3 std deviation from mean
15.	Z-score : https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/z-score/
	 	- How many std deviation a data point is away from mean in a distribution
16.	chebyshevs theorem in statistic : https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/chebyshevs-theorem-in-statistics/
		- Estimates minimum proportion of data points within K std deviation from mean
		- Estimates maximum proportion of data points outside K std deviation from mean
		- Works for any type of distribution
